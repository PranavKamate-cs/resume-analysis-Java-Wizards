ü§ñ AI-Powered Resume Ranker & Placement Portal
A modern, AI-driven web application designed to revolutionize the campus placement process for both students and placement officers.

## üéØ Problem Statement
Traditional campus recruitment processes are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human bias. Placement teams are inundated with hundreds of resumes for each job opening, making it challenging to:

Screen effectively and identify the best-fit candidates in a timely manner.

Provide personalized feedback to students to help them improve.

Ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation process, giving every student an equal opportunity.

Scale the process efficiently as the number of applicants and job roles grows.

This project aims to solve these challenges by leveraging AI to create a transparent, efficient, and equitable placement ecosystem.

## üí° Our Approach
This application tackles the problem with a multi-faceted, AI-first approach:

Dual-View System: Provides two distinct interfaces‚Äîa Student Portal for applying to jobs and tracking status, and a Placement Team Dashboard for managing jobs and candidates.

Hybrid AI Scoring Model: Instead of relying on a single metric, our core analysis engine combines three techniques for a robust and nuanced evaluation:

Keyword Matching: A baseline check for essential skills and qualifications.

Semantic Similarity: Uses Sentence Transformers to understand the contextual meaning of a resume, even if it doesn't use exact keywords.

LLM-Powered Analysis: Leverages Google's Gemini Pro via LangChain for deep contextual understanding, identifying strengths, and pinpointing skill gaps.

Automated & Fair Feedback: Every submitted resume is automatically analyzed. The system uses a fairness-aware prompt and redacts personal information (blind screening) to mitigate bias, ensuring the evaluation is based on merit.

Efficient Administrative Tools: The placement team is equipped with tools for bulk resume analysis, historical data access, and a dedicated Bias & Fairness Audit dashboard to monitor hiring outcomes.
